    <h1>Big Sur</h1>
    <h4>by Mira Kaiser</h4>
    <img src="project1.png" width="500" />
    <p> Inspired by a summer trip to Big Sur, California, this piece emulates features of wooden 3D topographical maps while combining the formal ideas of traditional paper collaging. Warm tones of the cliff mimic the golden hour lighting notable during sunset, and layers in the ocean scene aim to convey depth. This piece was created for the MAT 111PF Prototypying and Fabrication course during Summer 2024 at UC Santa Barbara.</p>

    <h1>Santa Cruz Mountains</h1>
    <h4>by Mira Kaiser</h4>
    <img src="project2.png" width="500" />
    <p>This minimalist piece depicts Mount Hood in Oregon in a more geometric and abstract form. The color palette is pulled from the rich colors of Oregon landscapes and geometric shapes convey the texture of the mountain. This piece was created as an album cover for an accompanying Spotify playlist of songs reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

    <h1>Mount Hood</h1>
    <h4>by Mira Kaiser</h4>
    <img src="project3.png" width="500" />
    <p>This piece uses old magazine scraps and craft paper to create a scene of the Santa Cruz mountains and the view from my hometown in the Bay Area, CA. Varying patterns and color convey texture and depth and utilize common collaging techniques of tearing paper giving a falsely worn look. The intended purpose is as a postcard or wall print.</p>
